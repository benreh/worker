Example usage
=============

Let's take a look at the following shell code snippet:

#!/bin/bash
for i in 1 2 3 4 5
do
	sleep 1;
done

normally it takes 5 seconds for this loop to run.

If we add the 'worker' by changing it to 

#!/bin/bash
for i in 1 2 3 4 5
do
	worker sleep 1;
done

on a machine that has for example two processors/cores, the loop
takes 2 seconds to finish. First 1 and 2 run simultaneously, then 3
and 4. The loop exits while job 5 is still running.

In some cases this is an unwanted side-effect and you want to wait for
all jobs to have finished. In that case you can add a 'worker --join'
at the end. The whole code now takes 3 seconds to run.

ATTENTION:
This program is in a very experimental stage.
That means it worked on two of my computers.

I'm still busy making it available for everyone else.
